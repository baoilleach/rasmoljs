DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       RasMol2 is a molecular graphics program intended  for  the
       visualisation   of   proteins,  nucleic  acids  and  small
       molecules. The program is aimed at display,  teaching  and
       generation  of  publication quality images. RasMol runs on
       Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, UNIX and VMS  systems.
       The UNIX and VMS systems require an 8, 24 or 32 bit colour
       X Windows display (X11R4 or later). The program reads in a
       molecule  co-ordinate  file and interactively displays the
       molecule on the screen in a variety of colour schemes  and
       molecule  representations. Currently available representa-
       tions include depth-cued  wireframes,  'Dreiding'  sticks,
       spacefilling  (CPK)  spheres,  ball  and  stick, solid and
       strand biomolecular ribbons, atom labels and dot surfaces.


CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       RasMol  allows the execution of interactive commands typed
       at the RRaassMMooll>> prompt in the terminal window. Each command
       must be given on a separate line. Keywords are case insen-
       sitive and may be entered in either upper  or  lower  case
       letters.  All  whitespace characters are ignored except to
       separate keywords and their arguments.

       The commands/keywords currently recognised by  RasMol  are
       given below.


       BBaacckkbboonnee
              The RasMol bbaacckkbboonnee command permits the representa-
              tion of a polypeptide backbone as a series of bonds
              connecting the adjacent alpha carbons of each amino
              acid in a chain.  The  display  of  these  backbone
              `bonds'  is  turned on and off by the command para-
              mater the same as the wwiirreeffrraammee command.  The  com-
              mand  bbaacckkbboonnee  ooffff turns off the selected `bonds',

              and bbaacckkbboonnee oonn or with a number turns them on. The
              number  can  be used to specify the cylinder radius
              of the representation in either Angstrom or  rasmol
              units.  A parameter value of 500 (2.0 Angstroms) or
              above results in  a  "Parameter  value  too  large"
              error.  Backbone  objects may be coloured using the
              RasMol ccoolloouurr bbaacckkbboonnee command.


       BBaacckkggrroouunndd
              The RasMol bbaacckkggrroouunndd command is used  to  set  the
              colour  of  the "canvas" background. The colour may
              be given as either a colour name or a  comma  sepa-
              rated  triple  of  Red, Green and Blue (RGB) compo-
              nents enclosed in square brackets. Typing the  com-
              mand  hheellpp  ccoolloouurrss  will give a list of the prede-
              fined colour names recognised by RasMol.  When run-
              ning   under  X  Windows,  RasMol  also  recognises
              colours in the X server's colour name database.

              The bbaacckkggrroouunndd command is synonymous with the  Ras-
              Mol sseett bbaacckkggrroouunndd command.


       CCeennttrree The  RasMol  cceennttrree command defines the point about
              which the rroottaattee command and the scroll bars rotate
              the  current molecule. Without a parameter the cen-
              tre command resets the centre of rotation to be the
              centre  of  gravity  of  the  molecule.  If an atom
              expression  is  specified,   RasMol   rotates   the
              molecule  about the centre of gravity of the set of
              atoms specified by the expression. Hence, if a sin-
              gle  atom is specified by the expression, that atom
              will remain `stationary' during rotations.

              atom expressions.


       CClliippbbooaarrdd
              The  RasMol  cclliippbbooaarrdd command places a copy of the
              currently displayed image  on  the  local  graphics
              `clipboard'.  Note:  this  command  is not yet sup-
              ported on UNIX or VMS machines. It is  intended  to
              make transfering images between applications easier
              under Microsoft Windows or on an Apple Macintosh.

              When using RasMol on a  UNIX  or  VMS  system  this
              functionality  may  be  achieved  by  generating  a
              raster image in a format that can be  read  by  the
              receiving program using the RasMol wwrriittee command.

              region. The colour may be given as either a  colour
              name  or a comma separated triple of Red, Green and
              Blue (RGB) components enclosed in square  brackets.
              Typing the command hheellpp ccoolloouurrss will give a list of
              all the predefined colour names recognised by  Ras-
              Mol.

              Allowed objects are aattoommss,, bboonnddss,, bbaacckkbboonnee,, rriibbbboonnss

              specified,  the  default  keyword  aattoomm is assumed.
              Some colour schemes are defined for certain  object
              types.  The  colour  scheme nnoonnee can be applied all
              objects accept atoms and  dots,  stating  that  the
              selected  objects  have no colour of their own, but
              use the colour of their associated atoms (i.e.  the
              atoms  they  connect).   AAttoomm  objects  can also be

       CCoonnnneecctt
              The RasMol ccoonnnneecctt command is used to force  RasMol
              to  (re)calculate  the  connectivity of the current
              molecule. If the original input file contained con-
              nectivity  information, this is discarded. The com-
              mand ccoonnnneecctt ffaallssee uses an extremely fast heuristic
              algorithmm  that  is suitable for determing bonding
              in large bio-molecules such as proteins and nucleic
              acids.  The command ccoonnnneecctt ttrruuee uses a slower more
              accurate algorithm based upon covalent  radii  that
              is  more  suitable  for  small molecules containing
              inorganic elements or strained rings. If no parame-
              ters  are  given, RasMol determines which algorithm
              to use based on the number of atoms  in  the  file.
              Greater  than  255  atoms  causes RasMol to use the
              faster implementation. This is the method  used  to
              determine bonding, if necessary, when a molecule is
              first read in using the llooaadd command.


       DDeeffiinnee The RasMol ddeeffiinnee command allows the user to  asso-
              ciate an arbitrary set of atoms with a unique iden-
              tifier. This allows the definition of  user-defined
              sets. These sets are declared statically, i.e. once
              defined the contents of the set do not change, even
              if the expression defining them depends on the cur-
              rent  transformation  and  representation  of   the
              molecule.


       DDoottss   The  RasMol  ddoottss command is used to generate a van



                          December 1998                         3





RASMOL(1)                                               RASMOL(1)


              der  Waal's  dot  surface  around   the   currently
              selected  atoms.  Dot  surfaces  display  regularly
              spaced points on a sphere of van der Waals'  radius
              about  each  selected  atom.  Dots  that  would are
              `buried' within the van der Waal's  radius  of  any
              other  atom  (selected  or  not) are not displayed.
              The command ddoottss oonn deletes any existing  dot  sur-
              face  and  generates a dots surface around the cur-
              rently selected atom set with a default dot density
              of  100.  The command ddoottss ooffff deletes any existing
              dot surface. The dot density may  be  specified  by
              providing  a  numeric parameter between 1 and 1000.
              This value approximately corresponds to the  number
              of dots on the surface of a medium sized atom.

              By  default, the colour of each point on a dot sur-
              face is the colour of it's closest atom at the time
              the  surface  is generated. The colour of the whole
              dot surface may be changed using  the  ccoolloouurr  ddoottss
              command.


       EEcchhoo   The  RasMol  eecchhoo command is used to display a mes-
              sage in the  RasMol  command/terminal  window.  The
              string  parameter  may  optionally  be delimited in
              double quote characters. If no parameter is  speci-
              fied,  the eecchhoo command displays a blank line. This
              command is particularly useful for displaying  text
              from within a RasMol ssccrriipptt file.


       HHBBoonnddss The  RasMol  hhbboonndd command is used to represent the
              hydrogen bonding of the  protein  molecule's  back-
              bone.  This  information is useful in assessing the
              protein's secondary structure. Hydrogen  bonds  are
              represented  as  either  dotted  lines or cylinders
              between the donor and acceptor residues. The  first
              time   the  hhbboonndd  command  is  used,  the  program
              searches the structure  of  the  molecule  to  find
              hydrogen  bonded residues and reports the number of
              bonds to the user. The command hhbboonnddss  oonn  displays
              the  selected  `bonds'  as  dotted  lines,  and the
              hhbboonnddss ooffff turns off their display. The  colour  of
              hbond  objects  may  be changed by the ccoolloouurr hhbboonndd
              command. Initially,  each  hydrogen  bond  has  the
              colours of its connected atoms.

              By  default  the dotted lines are drawn between the
              accepting oxygen  and  the  donating  nitrogen.  By
              using the sseett hhbboonnddss command the alpha carbon posi-
              tions of  the  appropriate  residues  may  be  used
              instead.  This  is especially useful when examining
              proteins in backbone representation.

       HHeellpp   The RasMol hheellpp command provides  on-line  help  on
              the given topic.


       LLaabbeell  The  RasMol  llaabbeell command allows an arbitrary for-
              matted text string to be associated with each  cur-
              rently  selected  atom.   This  string  may contain
              embedded `expansion specifiers' which display prop-
              erties  of  the  atom  being labelled. An expansion
              specifier consists of a `%' character followed by a
              single alphabetic character specifying the property
              to be displayed.  An actual '%'  character  may  be
              displayed by using the expansion specifier `%%'.

              Atom labelling for the currently selected atoms may
              be turned off  with  the  command  llaabbeell  ooffff..   By
              default,  if no string is given as a parameter Ras-
              Mol  uses  labels  appropriate  for   the   current
              molecule.

              The  colour  of each label may be changed using the
              ccoolloouurr llaabbeell command. By  default,  each  label  is
              drawn in the same colour as the atom to which it is
              attached. The size of the  displayed  text  may  be
              changed using the sseett ffoonnttssiizzee command.


       LLooaadd   Load  a  molecule  co-ordinate  file  into RasMol2.
              Valid molecule file  formats  are  ppddbb  (Brookhaven
              Protein  Databank), mmddll (Molecular Design Limited's
              MOL file format),  aallcchheemmyy  (Tripos'  Alchemy  file
              format),  mmooll22  (Tripos'  Sybyl  Mol2 file format),
              cchhaarrmmmm (CHARMm file format) or xxyyzz (MSC's XMol  XYZ
              file  format).  If no file format is specified, ppddbb
              is assumed by default. Only a single  molecule  may
              be loaded at a time.  To delete a molecule prior to
              loading another use the RasMol zzaapp command.

              The llooaadd command  selects  all  the  atoms  in  the
              molecule,  centres  it on the screen and renders it
              as a CPK coloured wireframe model. If the  molecule
              contains  no  bonds  (i.e. contains only alpha car-
              bons), it is drawn as an alpha carbon backbone.  If
              the  file  specifies  less bonds than atoms, RasMol
              determines connectivity using the ccoonnnneecctt  command.


       PPrriinntt  The  RasMol  pprriinntt command sends the currently dis-
              played image to the local default printer using the
              operating  system's  native  printer  driver. Note:
              this command is not yet  supported  under  UNIX  or

              When using RasMol on a  UNIX  or  VMS  system  this
              functionality  may be achieved by either generating
              a PostScript file using  the  RasMol  wwrriittee  ppss  or
              wwrriittee vveeccttppss commands and printing that or generat-

              The RasMol rreennuummbbeerr  command  sequentially  numbers
              the   residues  in  a  macromolecular  chain.   The
              optional parameter specifies the value of the first
              residue  in the sequence. By default, this value is
              one. For proteins, each amino acid is numbered con-
              secutively  from  the N terminus to the C terminus.
              For nucleic acids, each base is numbered  from  the
              5'  terminus to 3' terminus. All chains in the cur-
              rent database are renumbered and gaps in the origi-
              nal  sequence  are  ignored. The starting value for
              numbering may be negative.


       RReesseett  The RasMol  rreesseett  command  restores  the  original
              viewing  transformation and centre of rotation. The
              scale is set to it default  value,  zzoooomm  110000,,  the
              centre  of  rotation is set to the geometric centre
              of the currently loaded molecule, cceennttrree aallll,,  this
              centre  is  translated  to the middle of the screen
              and the viewpoint set to the default orientation.

              This command should not be mistaken for the  RasMol
              zzaapp  command  which  deletes  the  currently stored
              molecule, returning  the  program  to  its  initial
              state.


       RReessttrriicctt
              The  RasMol  rreessttrriicctt command both defines the cur-
              rently selected region of the molecule and disables
              the  representation of (most of) those parts of the
              molecule no longer selected.  All subsequent RasMol
              commands  that modify a molecule's colour or repre-
              sentation  effect  only  the   currently   selected
              region.  The  parameter  of a rreessttrriicctt command is a
              RasMol atom expression that is evaluated for  every
              atom  of the current molecule. This command is very
              similar  to  the  RasMol  sseelleecctt  command,   except
              restrict  disables  the  wwiirreeffrraammee,,  ssppaacceeffiillll  and

       RRiibbbboonnss
              The RasMol rriibbbboonnss command displays  the  currently
              loaded  protein  or  nucleic acid as a smooth solid
              "ribbon" surface passing along the backbone of  the
              protein.   The  ribbon  is drawn between each amino
              acid whose alpha carbon is currently selected.  The
              colour  of  the  ribbon  is  changed  by the RasMol
              ccoolloouurr rriibbbboonn command. If the current ribbon colour
              is nnoonnee (the default), the colour is taken from the
              alpha carbon at each position along its length.

              The width of the ribbon at each position is  deter-
              mined by the optional parameter in the usual RasMol
              units. By default the width of the ribbon is  taken
              from  the  secondary  structure of the protein or a
              constant value of 720 (2.88 Angstroms) for  nucleic
              acids.   The default width of protein alpha helices
              and beta sheets is 380  (1.52  Angstroms)  and  100
              (0.4 Angstroms) for turns and random coil. The sec-
              ondary structure assignment is either from the  PDB
              file or calculated using the DSSP algorithm as used
              by the ssttrruuccttuurree command. This command  is  similar
              to  the  RasMol  command  ssttrraannddss which renders the
              biomolecular ribbon as parallel depth-cued  curves.


       RRoottaattee Rotate the molecule about the specified axis.  Per-
              mited values for the axis parameter  are  "x",  "y"
              and "z".  The integer parameter states the angle in
              degrees for the structure to be rotated. For the  X
              and  Y axes, positive values move the closest point
              up and right, and negative values move it down  and
              left respectively. For the Z axis, a positive rota-
              tion acts clockwise  and  a  negative  angle  anti-
              clockwise.

              a Brookhaven Protein Database (PDB) or  Alchemy(tm)

              and the RasMol wwrriittee command has been dropped.  The
              only  difference is that without a format specifier
              the ssaavvee command generates a PPDDBB file and the wwrriittee
              command generates a GGIIFF image.

              commands sequentially from a text file and executes
              them.  This  allows sequences of commonly used com-
              mands to be stored and performed by single command.
              A  RasMol  script file may contain a further script
              command up to a maximum  "depth"  of  10,  allowing
              compilicated  sequences  of actions to be executed.
              RasMol ignores all characters after the  first  '#'
              character  on  each line allowing the scripts to be
              annotated. Script files are  often  also  annotated
              using the RasMol eecchhoo command.

              The  most  common  way  to generate a RasMol script
              file is to use the wwrriittee  ssccrriipptt  or  wwrriittee  rraassmmooll
              commands  to  output  the sequence of commands that
              are needed to regenerate the current  view,  repre-
              sentation  and colouring of the currently displayed
              molecule.

              The RasMol command ssoouurrccee is  synonymous  with  the
              ssccrriipptt command.


       SSeelleecctt Define   the   currently  selected  region  of  the
              molecule.  All  subsequent  RasMol  commands   that
              manipulate  a molecule or modify its colour or rep-
              resentation, only effects  the  currently  selected
              region. The parameter of a sseelleecctt command is a Ras-
              Mol expression that is evaluated for every atom  of
              the   current   molecule.  The  currently  selected
              (active) region of the  molecule  are  those  atoms
              that  cause  the  expression  to  evaluate true. To
              select the whole molecule use  the  RasMol  command
              sseelleecctt  aallll..   The  behaviour of the sseelleecctt command
              without any parameters is determined by the  RasMol
              hheetteerroo and hhyyddrrooggeenn parameters.

              Mol atom expressions.


       SSeett    The RasMol sseett command allows  the  user  to  alter
              various  internal  program parameters such as those
              controlling rendering options. Each  parameter  has
              its own set or permissible parameter options. Typi-
              cally, ommiting the  paramter  option  resets  that
              parameter  to  its  default  value. A list of valid
              parameter names is given below.


       SShhooww   The RasMol sshhooww command display details of the sta-

              disulphide bridges or secondary structure have been
              determined, the number of hbonds, ssbonds, helices,
              ladders  and turns are also displayed respectively.
              The command sshhooww sseeqquueennccee lists the  residues  that
              compose each chain of the molecule.


       SSllaabb   The  RasMol ssllaabb command enables, disables or posi-
              tions the z-clipping plane  of  the  molecule.  The
              program  only  draws those portions of the molecule
              that are further from the viewer than the  slabbing
              plane.  Values range  from zero at the very back of
              the molecule to 100 which is completely in front of
              the  molecule.  Intermediate  values  determine the
              percentage of the molecule to be drawn.


       SSppaacceeffiillll
              The RasMol ssppaacceeffiillll command is used  to  represent
              all  of  the  currently  selected  atoms  as  solid
              spheres. This  command  is  used  to  produce  both
              union-of-spheres  and  ball-and-stick  models  of a
              molecule.  The  command,   ssppaacceeffiillllll   ttrruuee,,   the
              default,  represents  each  atom as a sphere of van
              der Waals radius.  The command ssppaacceeffiillll ooffff  turns
              off  the  representation  of  the  selected atom as
              spheres. A sphere radius may  be  specified  as  an
              integer  in  RasMol  units  (1/250th Angstrom) or a
              value containing a decimal point. A  value  of  500
              (2.0  Angstroms) or greater results in a "Parameter
              value too large" error.

              The tteemmppeerraattuurree option  sets  the  radius  of  each
              sphere  to  the  value  stored  in  its temperature
              field. Zero  or  negative  values  causes  have  no
              effect and values greater than 2.0 are truncated to
              2. The  uusseerr  option  allows  the  radius  of  each
              spheres  to be specified by additional lines in the
              molecule's PDB file using Raster 3D's COLOR  record
              extension.

              The  RasMol  command  ccppkk  is  synonymous  with the
              ssppaacceeffiillll command.


       SSSSBBoonnddss
              The RasMol ssssbboonnddss command is used to represent the
              disulphide  bridges  of  the  protein  molecule  as
              either dotted lines or cylinders between  the  con-
              nected  cysteines.  The first time that the ssssbboonnddss
              command is used, the program searches the structure
              of  the  protein  to find half-cysteine pairs (cys-
              teines whose sulphurs are  within  3  Angstroms  of
              each  other)  and  reports the number of bridges to

              the user.  The  command  ssssbboonnddss  oonn  displays  the
              selected  `bonds'  as dotted lines, and the command
              ssssbboonnddss ooffff disables the display of ssbonds in  the
              currently  selected  area.  Selection of disulphide
              bridges is identical to normal bonds,  and  may  be
              adjusted using the RasMol sseett bboonnddmmooddee command. The
              colour of disulphide bonds may be changed using the
              ccoolloouurr ssssbboonnddss command. By default, each disulphide
              bond has the colours of its connected atoms.

              By default disulphide bonds are drawn  between  the
              sulphur  atoms within the cysteine groups. By using
              the sseett ssssbboonnddss command the position  of  the  cys-
              teine's alpha carbons may be used instead.


       SSttrraannddss
              The  RasMol  ssttrraannddss command displays the currently
              loaded protein or nucleic acid as a smooth "ribbon"
              of  depth-cued curves passing along the backbone of
              the protein. The ribbon is composed of a number  of
              strands  that run parallel to one another along the
              peptide plane of each residue. The ribbon is  drawn
              between  each amino acid whose alpha carbon is cur-
              rently selected.   The  colour  of  the  ribbon  is
              changed by the RasMol ccoolloouurr rriibbbboonn command. If the
              current ribbon colour is nnoonnee  (the  default),  the
              colour is taken from the alpha carbon at each posi-
              tion along its length. The colour  of  the  central
              and outermost strands may be coloured independently
              using the ccoolloouurr rriibbbboonn11 and  ccoolloouurr  rriibbbboonn22  com-
              mands  respectively.  The  number of strands in the
              ribbon may be altered using the RasMol sseett  ssttrraannddss
              command.

              The  width of the ribbon at each position is deter-
              mined by the optional parameter in the usual RasMol
              units.  By default the width of the ribbon is taken
              from the secondary structure of the  protein  or  a
              constant value of 720 for nucleic acids (which pro-
              duces a ribbon 2.88 Angstroms wide).   The  default
              width  of  protein alpha helices and beta sheets is
              380 (1.52 Angstroms) and 100  (0.4  Angstroms)  for
              turns  and  random  coil.  The  secondary structure
              assignment is either from the PDB  file  or  calcu-
              lated  using  the  DSSP  algorithm  as  used by the
              ssttrruuccttuurree command. This command is similar  to  the
              RasMol command rriibbbboonnss which renders the biomolecu-
              lar ribbon as a smooth shaded surface.

              tural  assignment  records  (HELIX and SHEET) these
              are discarded.  Initially, the  hydrogen  bonds  of
              the current molecule are found, if this hasn't been
              done already. The secondary structure is the deter-
              mined  using  Kabsch  and  Sander's DSSP algorithm.
              Once finished the program  reports  the  number  of
              helices, strands and turns found.


       TTrraannssllaattee
              The  RasMol ttrraannssllaattee command moves the position of
              the centre of the molecule on the screen. The  axis
              parameter  specifies  along which axis the molecule
              is to be moved and the integer parameter  specifies
              the  absolute  position of the molecule centre from
              the middle of the screen.  Permited values for  the
              axis  parameter are "x", "y" and "z".  Displacement
              values must be between -100 and  100  which  corre-
              spond  to  moving the current molecule just off the
              screen.  A  positive  "x"  displacement  moves  the
              molecule to the right, and a positive "y" displace-
              ment moves the molecule down the screen.  The  pair
              of commands ttrraannssllaattee xx 00 and ttrraannssllaattee yy 00 centres

              The RasMol wwiirreeffrraammee command represents  each  bond
              within  the  selected  region  of  the  molecule as
              either a cylinder, a line or depth-cued vector. The
              display  of  bonds  as  depth-cued  vectors  (drawn
              darker the further away from the viewer) is  turned
              on  by  the command wwiirreeffrraammee or wwiirreeffrraammee oonn..  The
              selected bonds are displayed as cylinders by speci-
              fying a radius either as an integer in RasMol units
              or  containing  a  decimal  point  as  a  value  in
              Angstroms.    A   parameter   value   of  500  (2.0
              Angstroms) or above results in an "Parameter  value
              too  large"  error. Bonds may be coloured using the
              ccoolloouurr bboonnddss command.

              raster  format. Currently supported image file for-
              mats include ggiiff (Compuserve  GIF),  ppppmm  (Portable
              Pixmap),  rraass (Sun rasterfile), ppss and eeppssff (Encap-

              lated  PostScript), bbmmpp (Microsoft bitmap) and ppiicctt
              (Apple PICT). The wwrriittee command may also be used to
              generate  command  scripts  for other graphics pro-
              grams. The format ssccrriipptt writes out a file contain-

              commands required to render the current view of the
              molecule as ribbons in Per Kraulis' Molscript  pro-
              gram and the format kkiinneemmaaggee the commands for David
              Richardson's program Mage.

              The distinction between this command and the RasMol
              ssaavvee  command has been dropped. The only difference
              is that without a format specifier the ssaavvee command
              generates  a  PPDDBB file and the wwrriittee command gener-
              ates a GGIIFF image.


       ZZaapp    Deletes the contents of the  current  database  and
              resets parameter variables to their initial default
              state.


       ZZoooomm   Change the magnification of the currently displayed
              image.  Boolean  parameters either magnify or reset
              the scale of current molecule. An integer parameter
              specifies the desired magnification as a percentage
              of the default scale. The minimum  parameter  value
              is  10,  the  maximum  parameter value is dependent
              upon the size of the molecule being displayed.  For
              medium sized proteins this is about 500.


SSEETT PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS
       RasMol  has  a  number  of internal parameters that may be
       modified using the sseett command. These parameters control a
       number  of  program  options such as rendering options and
       mouse button mappings.


       SSeett AAmmbbiieenntt
              The RasMol aammbbiieenntt parameter is used to control the
              amount  of  ambient  (or  surrounding) light in the
              scene. The aammbbiieenntt value must be between 0 and  100
              that controls the percentage intensity of the dark-
              est shade of an object. For a solid object, this is
              the  intensity  of  surfaces  facing  away from the
              light source or in shadow.  For depth-cued  objects
              this  is the intensity of objects furthest from the
              viewer.

              This parameter is commonly used to correct for mon-
              itors  with  different "gamma values" (brightness),
              to change  how  light  or  dark  a  hardcopy  image
              appears  when  printed  or  to alter the feeling of
              depth for wireframe or ribbon representations.


       SSeett AAxxeess
              The RasMol aaxxeess parameter controls the  display  of

RASMOL(1)                                               RASMOL(1)


              orthogonal co-ordinate axes on the current display.
              The co-ordinate axes are those used in the molecule
              data  file,  and  the  origin  is the centre of the
              molecule's bounding box. The sseett  aaxxeess  command  is
              similar the the commands sseett bboouunnddbbooxx and sseett uunniitt--
              cceellll that display the bounding box and the crystal-
              lographic unit cell respectively.


       SSeett BBaacckkggrroouunndd
              The  RasMol bbaacckkggrroouunndd parameter is used to set the
              colour of the "canvas" background. The  colour  may
              be  given  as either a colour name or a comma sepa-
              rated triple of Red, Green, Blue  (RGB)  components
              enclosed  in  square  brackets.  Typing the command
              hheellpp ccoolloouurrss will give a  list  of  the  predefined
              colour  names  recognised  by RasMol.  When running
              under X Windows, RasMol also recognises colours  in
              the X server's colour name database.

              The  command  sseett bbaacckkggrroouunndd is synonymous with the
              RasMol command bbaacckkggrroouunndd..


       SSeett BBoonnddMMooddee
              The RasMol sseett bboonnddmmooddee command controls the mecha-
              nism  used  to  select individual bonds. When using
              the sseelleecctt and rreessttrriicctt commands, a given bond will
              be  selected if i) the bondmode is oorr and either of
              the connected atoms is selected, or ii)  the  bond-
              mode  is  aanndd  and both atoms connected by the bond
              are selected.  Hence  an  individual  bond  may  be
              uniquely  identified by using the command sseett bboonndd--
              mmooddee aanndd and then uniquely selecting the  atoms  at
              both ends.


       SSeett BBoouunnddBBooxx
              The  RasMol bboouunnddbbooxx parameter controls the display
              of the current molecules bounding box on  the  dis-
              play.  The  bounding  box is orthogonal to the data
              file's original co-ordinate axes. The sseett  bboouunnddbbooxx
              command  is  similar  the the commands sseett aaxxeess and
              sseett uunniittcceellll that  display  orthogonal  co-ordinate
              axes and the bounding box respectively.


       SSeett DDiissppllaayy
              This  command controls the display mode within Ras-
              Mol. By default, sseett ddiissppllaayy  nnoorrmmaall,,  RasMol  dis-
              plays  the molecule in the representation specified
              by the  user.  The  command  sseett  ddiissppllaayy  sseelleecctteedd
              changes  the display mode such that the molecule is
              temporarily  drawn  so  as  to  indicate  currently

              selected  portion  of the molecule. The user speci-
              fied  colour  scheme  and  representation   remains
              unchanged.   In  this  representation  all selected
              atoms are shown in  yellow  and  all  non  selected
              atoms  are  shown  in blue. The colour of the back-
              ground is also changed to a dark grey  to  indicate
              the  change of display mode.  This command is typi-
              cally only used by external Graphical  User  Inter-
              faces (GUIs).


       SSeett HHBBoonnddss
              The  RasMol  hhbboonnddss  parameter  determines  whether
              hydrogen bonds are  drawn  between  the  donor  and
              acceptor  atoms  of  the  hydrogen bond, sseett hhbboonnddss
              ssiiddeecchhaaiinn or between the alpha carbon atoms of  the
              protein  backbone and between the phosphorous atoms
              of the nucleic acid backbone, sseett hhbboonnddss  bbaacckkbboonnee..
              The  actual display of hydrogen bonds is controlled
              by  the  hhbboonnddss  command.  Drawing  hydrogen  bonds
              between protein alpha carbons or nucleic acid phos-
              phorous atoms  is  useful  when  the  rest  of  the
              molecule  is  shown in only a schematic representa-
              tion such as bbaacckkbboonnee,,  rriibbbboonnss  or  ssttrraannddss..   his
              parameter  is similar to the RasMol ssssbboonnddss parame-
              ter.


       SSeett FFoonnttSSiizzee
              The RasMol sseett ffoonnttssiizzee command is used to  control
              the  size  of the characters that form atom labels.
              This value corresponds to the height  of  the  dis-
              played  character  in  pixels. The maximum value of
              ffoonnttssiizzee is 32 pixels, and the default value  is  8
              pixels  high.  To display atom labels on the screen
              use the RasMol llaabbeell  command  and  to  change  the
              colour  of  displayed labels, use the ccoolloouurr llaabbeellss
              command.


       SSeett HHeetteerroo
              The RasMol hheetteerroo parameter is used to  modify  the
              `default'  behaviour  of the RasMol sseelleecctt command,
              i.e. the behaviour of sseelleecctt  without  any  parame-
              ters.  When this value is ffaallssee,, the default sseelleecctt
              region does  not  include  an  heterogeneous  atoms
              (refer  to  the  predefined set hheetteerroo ). When this
              value is ttrruuee,, the default sseelleecctt region  may  con-
              tain hetero atoms. This parameter is similar to the
              RasMol hhyyddrrooggeenn parameter which determines  whether
              hydrogen  atoms  should  be included in the default
              set. If both hheetteerroo and hhyyddrrooggeenn are  ttrruuee,,  sseelleecctt
              without any parameters is equivalent to sseelleecctt aallll..

       SSeett HHoouurrGGllaassss
              The RasMol hhoouurrggllaassss parameter allows the  user  to
              enable and disable the use of the `hour glass' cur-
              sor used by RasMol to indicate that the program  is
              currently  busy drawing the next frame. The command
              sseett hhoouurrggllaassss oonn enable the indicator,  whilst  sseett
              hhoouurrggllaassss  ooffff  prevents  RasMol  from changing the
              cursor. This is useful when spinning the  molecule,
              running  a  sequence of commands from a script file
              or using interprocess communication to execute com-
              plex  sequences  of  commands.  In  these  cases  a
              `flashing' cursor may be distracting.


       SSeett HHyyddrrooggeenn
              The RasMol hhyyddrrooggeenn parameter is used to modify the
              `default'  behaviour  of the RasMol sseelleecctt command,
              i.e. the behaviour of sseelleecctt  without  any  parame-
              ters.  When this value is ffaallssee,, the default sseelleecctt
              region does not include any hydrogen  or  deuterium
              atoms (refer to the predefined set hhyyddrrooggeenn ). When
              this value is ttrruuee,, the default sseelleecctt  region  may
              contain  hydrogen  atoms. This parameter is similar
              to the RasMol  hheetteerroo  parameter  which  determines
              whether  heterogeneous  atoms should be included in
              the default set. If both hhyyddrrooggeenn  and  hheetteerroo  are
              ttrruuee,,  sseelleecctt  without any parameters is equivalent
              to sseelleecctt aallll..


       SSeett KKiinneemmaaggee
              The RasMol sseett kkiinneemmaaggee command controls the amount
              of  detail  stored in a Kinemage output file gener-
              ated by the RasMol wwrriittee kkiinneemmaaggee command. The out-
              put  kinemage files are intended to be displayed by
              David  Richardson's  Mage  program.   sseett  kkiinneemmaaggee
              ffaallssee,,  the default, only stores the currently dis-
              played representation in the generated output file.
              The  command  sseett  kkiinneemmaaggee  ttrruuee,, generates a more
              complex Kinemage that contains both  the  wireframe
              and  backbone  representations  as  well as the co-
              ordinate axes, bounding box and crystal unit  cell.


       SSeett MMeennuuss
              The  RasMol  sseett  mmeennuuss  command enables the canvas
              window's menu buttons or menu bar. This command  is
              typically only used by graphical user interfaces or
              to create as large as image as possible when  using
              Microsoft Windows.

              translation, scaling and  zooming  mouse  bindings.
              The  default  value is rraassmmooll which is suitable for
              two button mice (for three button mice  the  second
              and  third buttons are synonymous); X-Y rotation is
              controlled by the first button, and X-Y translation
              by  the second. Additional functions are controlled
              by holding a modifier key on the keyboard.  [Shift]
              and  the first button performs scaling, [shift] and
              the second button performs  Z-rotation,  and  [con-
              trol] and the first mouse button controls the clip-
              ping plane. The iinnssiigghhtt and qquuaannttaa provide the same
              mouse  bindings  as  other packages for experienced
              users.


       SSeett RRaaddiiuuss
              The RasMol sseett rraaddiiuuss command is used to alter  the
              behaviour of the RasMol ddoottss command depending upon
              the value of the ssoollvveenntt parameter.   When  ssoollvveenntt
              is  ttrruuee,,  the  rraaddiiuuss parameter controls whether a
              true van der Waal's surface  is  generated  by  the
              ddoottss  command.  If  the value of rraaddiiuuss is anything
              other than zero, that value is used as  the  radius
              of each atom instead of it true VdW value. When the
              value of ssoollvveenntt is ttrruuee,, this parameter determines
              the `probe sphere' (solvent) radius.  The parameter
              may be given as an integer in rasmol units or  con-
              taining  a  decimal point in Angstroms. The default
              value of this parameter is determined by the  value
              of  ssoollvveenntt  and  changing ssoollvveenntt resets rraaddiiuuss to
              its new default value.


       SSeett SShhaaddooww
              The RasMol sseett sshhaaddooww command enables and  disables
              raytracing  of  the currently rendered image.  Cur-
              rently  only  the  spacefilling  representation  is
              shadowed  or  can  cast shadows. Enabling shadowing
              will automatically disable  the  Z-clipping  (slab-
              bing) plane using the command ssllaabb ooffff..  Raytracing
              typically takes about 10s for  a  moderately  sized
              protein.   It is recommended that shadowing is nor-
              mally disabled whilst the molecule is being  trans-
              formed  or  manipulated,  and  only enabled once an
              appropiate viewpoint  is  selected,  to  provide  a
              greater impression of depth.

              The  RasMol ssllaabbmmooddee parameter controls the render-
              ing method of objects cut by the slabbing  (z-clip-
              ping)   plane.   Valid   slabmode   parameters  are
              "reject", "half", "hollow", "solid" and  "section".

       SSeett SSoollvveenntt
              The  RasMol  sseett ssoollvveenntt command is used to control
              the behaviour of the RasMol ddoottss command. Depending
              upon  the  value of the ssoollvveenntt parameter, the ddoottss
              command either generates a van der Waal's or a sol-
              vent   acessible   surface   around  the  currently
              selected set  of  atoms.  Changing  this  parameter
              automatically resets the value of the RasMol rraaddiiuuss
              parameter.  The  command  sseett  ssoollvveenntt  ffaallssee,,  the
              default value, indicates that a van der Waal's sur-
              face should be generated and resets  the  value  of
              rraaddiiuuss  to zero. The command sseett ssoollvveenntt ttrruuee indi-
              cates  that  a  `Connolly'  or  `Richards'  solvent
              accessible  surface  should  be  drawn and sets the
              rraaddiiuuss  parameter,  the  solvent  radius,  to   1.2
              Angstroms (or 300 RasMol units).


       SSeett SSppeeccuullaarr
              The  RasMol  sseett  ssppeeccuullaarr command enables and dis-
              ables the display of specular highlights  on  solid
              objects drawn by RasMol. Specular highlights appear
              as white reflections of the  light  source  on  the
              surface of the object. The current RasMol implemen-
              tation uses an approximation function  to  generate
              this highlight.

              The  specular  highlights  on the surfaces of solid
              objects  may  be  altered  by  using  the  specular
              reflection  coefficient, which is altered using the
              RasMol sseett ssppeeccppoowweerr command.


       SSeett SSppeeccPPoowweerr
              The ssppeeccppoowweerr parameter determines the shininess of
              solid   objects  rendered  by  RasMol.  This  value
              between 0 and 100 adjusts the reflection  coeffient
              used in specular highlight calculations. The specu-
              lar highlights are enabled and disabled by the Ras-
              Mol  sseett  ssppeeccuullaarr  command. Values around 20 or 30
              produce plastic looking surfaces.  High values rep-
              resent  more  shiny  surfaces such as metals, while
              lower values produce more diffuse/dull surfaces.


       SSeett SSSSBBoonnddss
              The RasMol  ssssbboonnddss  parameter  determines  whether
              disulphide  bridges  are  drawn between the sulphur
              atoms in the sidechain (the default) or between the
              alpha carbon atoms in the backbone of the cysteines
              residues. The actual display of disulphide  bridges
              is  controlled  by  the  ssssbboonnddss  command.  Drawing
              disulphide bridges between alpha carbons is  useful
              when  the  rest  of  the protein is shown in only a

              The RasMol ssttrraannddss parameter controls the number of
              parallel  strands  that are displayed in the ribbon
              representations of proteins. The permissible values
              for  this  parameter  are  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9. The
              default value is 5. The number of strands  is  con-
              stant  for  all  ribbons being displayed.  However,
              the ribbon width (the separation  between  strands)
              may  be  controlled  on  a residue by residue basis
              using the RasMol rriibbbboonnss command.

              The RasMol uunniittcceellll parameter controls the  display
              of  the  crystallographic  unit cell on the current
              display. The crystal cell is only  enabled  if  the
              appropriate  crystal  symmetry  information is con-
              tained in the PDB data  file.  The  RasMol  command
              sshhooww  ssyymmmmeettrryy  display  details  of  the crystal's
              space group and unit cell axes.  The  sseett  uunniittcceellll
              command  is  similar  the the commands sseett aaxxeess and
              sseett bboouunnddbbooxx that  display  orthogonal  co-ordinate

              The  RasMol  vveeccttppss parameter is use to control the
              way in which the  RasMol  wwrriittee  command  generates
              vector  PostScript  output  files.  The command sseett

              spheres and cylinder bonds producing `cartoon-like'
              high resolution output. However, the current imple-
              mentation  of  RasMol  incorrectly cartoons spheres
              that are intersected by more than one other sphere.
              Hence  `ball  and  stick'  models are rendered cor-
              rectly by not large  spacefilling  spheres  models.

       RasMol atom expressions  uniquely  identify  an  arbitrary
       group  of  atoms  within  a molecule. Atom expressions are
       composed of either primitive expressions, predefined sets,
       comparison   operators,  wwiitthhiinn  expressions,  or  logical
       (boolean) combinations of the above expression types.

       (brackets) may be used to  alter  the  precedence  of  the
       operators.  For  convenience, a comma may also be used for
       boolean disjunction.

       The atom expression is evaluated for each atom, hence pprroo--
       tteeiinn  aanndd  bbaacckkbboonnee selects protein bacbone atoms, not the

              RasMol primitive expressions  are  the  fundamental
              building  blocks of atom expressions. There are two
              types of primitive expression.  The first  type  is
              used to identify a given residue number or range of
              residue numbers. A single residue is identified  by
              its  number (position in the sequence), and a range
              is specified by lower and upper bounds separated by
              a  hyphen  character. For example sseelleecctt 55,,66,,77,,88 is
              also sseelleecctt 55--88..  Note that this selects the  given
              residue numbers in all macromolecule chains.

              The second type of primitive expression specifies a
              sequence of fields that  must  match  for  a  given
              atom.  The first part specifies a residue (or group
              of residues) and an optional second part  specifies
              the  atoms  within  those  residues. The first part
              consists of a residue name, optionally followed  by
              a residue number and/or chain identifier.  The sec-
              ond part consists of a period character followed by
              an  atom  name.   An asterisk may be used as a wild
              card for a whole field and a  question  mark  as  a
              single character wildcard.

              Parts of a molecule may also be distinguished using
              equality,  inequality  and  ordering  operators  on
              their  properties.  The  format  of such comparison
              expression is a property name, followed by  a  com-
              parison operator and then an integer value.

              The  atom properties that may be used in RasMol are
              aattoommnnoo for the atom serial number, eelleemmnnoo  for  the
              atom's  atomic  number  (element),  rreessnnoo  for  the
              residue number, rraaddiiuuss for the spacefill radius  in
              RasMol  units  (or  zero  if  not  represented as a
              sphere) and tteemmppeerraattuurree  for  the  PDB  anisotropic
              temperature value.

              The  equality  operator  is  denoted  either "=" or
              "==".  The inequality operator as either "<>", "!="

              A RasMol  wwiitthhiinn  expression  allows  atoms  to  be
              selected  on  their  proximity  to  another  set of
              atoms. A wwiitthhiinn  expression  takes  two  parameters
              separated by a comma and surrounded by parenthesis.
              The first argument is an integer value  called  the
              "cut-off" distance of the within expression and the
              second argument is any  valid atom expression.  The
              cut-off  distance  is  expressed  in either integer
              RasMol units  or  Angstroms  containing  a  decimal
              point.   An  atom  is  selected if it is within the
              cut-off distance of any of the atoms defined by the
              second argument. This allows complex expressions to
              be constructed  containing  nested  wwiitthhiinn  expres-
              sions.

              For  example,  the  command sseelleecctt wwiitthhiinn((33..22,,bbaacckk--
              bboonnee)) selects any atom within a 3.2 Angstrom radius
              of  any atom in a protein or nucleic acid backbone.
              WWiitthhiinn  expressions  are  particularly  useful  for
              selecting the atoms around an active site.

              RasMol  atom  expressions  may  contain  predefined
              sets. These sets are single keywords that represent
              portions  of  a  molecule  of interest.  Predefined
              sets are often abbreviations primitive atom expres-
              sions,  and  in  some cases of selecting areas of a

              This set contains the atoms in  those  amino  acids
              that  tend  (prefer)  to  be on the surface of pro-
              teins, in contact with solvent molecules. This  set
              refers  to  the  amino acids preference and not the
              actual solvent accessibility for the  current  pro-

              ssuurrffaaccee or bbuurriieedd..  This set is equivalent  to  the

              author  or  Kabsch  and Sander's DSSP algorithm. By
              default, RasMol uses the secondary structure deter-
              mination  given in the PDB file if it exists.  Oth-
              erwise, it uses the DSSP algorithm as used  by  the

CCOOLLOOUURR SSCCHHEEMMEESS
       The RasMol ccoolloouurr command allows different  objects  (such
       as  atoms, bonds and ribbon segments) to be given a speci-
       fied colour. Typically this colour is either a RasMol pre-
       defined  colour name or an RGB triple. Additionally RasMol
       also supports ccppkk,, aammiinnoo,, cchhaaiinn,,  ggrroouupp,,  sshhaappeellyy,,  ssttrruucc--

       eelleeccttrroossttaattiicc  ppootteennttiiaall  colour  scheme for dot surfaces.
       The currently predefined colour  names  are  blue,  black,
       cyan,  green,  greenblue,  magenta,  orange,  purple, red,
       redorange, violet, white and yellow.


       AAmmiinnoo CCoolloouurrss
              The RasMol aammiinnoo colour scheme colours amino  acids
              according to traditional amino acid properties. The
              purpose of colouring is to identify amino acids  in
              an  unusual  or  surprising  environment. The outer
              parts of a  protein  that  are  polar  are  visible
              (bright)  colours  and  non-polar  residues darker.
              Most colours are hallowed by tradition. This colour
              scheme is similar to the sshhaappeellyy scheme.


       CChhaaiinn CCoolloouurrss
              The  RasMol cchhaaiinn colour scheme assigns each macro-
              molecular chain a unique colour. This colour scheme
              is particularly useful for distinguishing the parts
              of multimeric structure or the individual `strands'
              of a DNA chain.


       CCPPKK CCoolloouurrss
              The  RasMol  ccppkk  colour  scheme  is based upon the
              colours of the popular plastic spacefilling  models
              which  were  developed  by Corey, Pauling and later
              improved  by  Kultun.  This  colour  scheme  colour
              `atom'  objects by the atom (element) type. This is
              the scheme conventionally used by chemists.


       GGrroouupp CCoolloouurrss
              The  RasMol  ggrroouupp  colour  scheme   colour   codes
              residues  by  their  position  in  a macromolecular
              chain. Each chain is drawn  as  a  smooth  spectrum
              from  blue through green, yellow and orange to red.
              Hence the N terminus of proteins and 5' terminus of
              nucleic  acids  are coloured red and the C terminus

              of proteins and 3' terminus of  nucleic  acids  are
              drawn  in  blue.  If  a chain has a large number of
              heterogeneous molecules  associated  with  it,  the
              macromolecule  may not be drawn in the full `range'
              of the spectrum.


       SShhaappeellyy CCoolloouurrss
              The  RasMol  sshhaappeellyy  colour  scheme  colour  codes
              residues  by  amino  acid  property. This scheme is
              based upon Bob Fletterick's "Shapely Models".  Each
              amino  acid  and  nucleic  acid  residue is given a
              unique colour. The sshhaappeellyy colour scheme is used by
              David  Bacon's Raster3D program. This colour scheme
              is similar to the aammiinnoo colour scheme.


       SSttrruuccttuurree CCoolloouurrss
              The RasMol  ssttrruuccttuurree  colour  scheme  colours  the
              molecule  by  protein  secondary  structure.  Alpha
              helices are  coloured  magenta,  [240,0,128],  beta
              sheets  are coloured yellow, [255,255,0], turns are
              coloured pale  blue,  [96,128,255]  and  all  other
              residues  are  coloured white. The secondary struc-
              ture is either read from the PDB  file  (HELIX  and
              SHEET  records),  if available, or determined using
              Kabsch and  Sander's  DSSP  algorithm.  The  RasMol
              ssttrruuccttuurree  command  may  be  used  to  force DSSP's
              structure assignment to be used.


       TTeemmppeerraattuurree CCoolloouurrss
              The RasMol tteemmppeerraattuurree colour scheme  colour  codes
              each  atom according to the anisotropic temperature
              (beta) value stored in the PDB file. Typically this
              gives  a  measure  of the mobility/uncertainty of a
              given atom's position. High values are coloured  in
              warmer  (red)  colours  and  lower values in colder
              (blue) colours. This feature is often used to asso-
              ciate a "scale" value [such as amino acid variabil-
              ity in viral mutants] with each atom in a PDB file,
              and colour the molecule appropriately.

              The  difference  between the tteemmppeerraattuurree and cchhaarrggee
              colour schemes is that increasing temperature  val-
              ues  proceed  from  blue to red, whereas increasing
              charge valuse go from red to blue.


       CChhaarrggee CCoolloouurrss
              The RasMol cchhaarrggee colour scheme colour  codes  each
              atom  according  to  the charge value stored in the
              input file (or beta factor  field  of  PDB  files).
              High  values  are  coloured  in blue (positive) and



                          December 1998                        28





RASMOL(1)                                               RASMOL(1)


              lower values coloured  in  red  (negative).  Rather
              than  use  a fixed scale this scheme determines the
              maximum and minimum values of  the  charge/tempera-
              ture field and interpolates from red to blue appro-
              priately. Hence, green cannot be assumed to be  `no
              net charge' charge.

              The  difference  between the cchhaarrggee and tteemmppeerraattuurree
              colour schemes is that increasing temperature  val-
              ues  proceed  from  blue to red, whereas increasing
              charge valuse go from red to blue.

              If the charge/temperature field  stores  reasonable
              values it is possible to use the RasMol ccoolloouurr ddoottss
              ppootteennttiiaall command to  colour  code  a  dot  surface
              (generated  by  the  ddoottss command) by electrostatic
              potential.


       UUsseerr CCoolloouurrss
              The RasMol uusseerr colour scheme allows RasMol to  use
              the  colour  scheme  stored  in  the  PDB file. The
              colours for each atom are stored  in  COLO  records
              placed  in  the  PDB data file. This convention was
              introduced by David Bacon's Raster3D program.


       HHBBoonndd TTyyppee CCoolloouurrss
              The RasMol  ttyyppee  colour  scheme  applies  only  to
              hydrogen bonds, hence is used in the command ccoolloouurr
              hhbboonnddss ttyyppee This scheme colour codes each  hydrogen
              bond  according  to  the  distance  along a protein
              chain between hydrogen  bond  donor  and  acceptor.
              This  schematic  representation  was  introduced by
              Belhadj-Mostefa and Milner-White. This  representa-
              tion  gives  a  good insight into protein secondary
              structure (hbonds forming alpha helices appear red,
              those  forming sheets appear yellow and those form-
              ing turns appear magenta).


       PPootteennttiiaall CCoolloouurrss
              The RasMol ppootteennttiiaall colour scheme applies only  to
              dot  surfaces,  hence is used in the command ccoolloouurr
              ddoottss ppootteennttiiaall This scheme colours  each  currently
              displayed  dot  by  the  electrostatic potential at
              that point in space. This potential  is  calculated
              using  Coulomb's  law taking the temperature/charge
              field of the input file to be the charge  assocated
              with  that  atom.  This  is the same interpretation
              used by the ccoolloouurr cchhaarrggee command. Like the  cchhaarrggee
              colour  scheme  low  values are blue/white and high
              values are red.
